This repository contains a dataset that I used in a Computer Science course for a final project, as well as functions to wrangle said dataset. Credit goes to Stephen Fickas, the professor of the course, for assistance and a portion of the code used here.

The dataset was obtained from the following site:

**Update 3/8/2023: I have uploaded two files, a wrangling file and a tuning file. If you are a recruiter or a university, please contact me so I can work the Flask server running if you would like to see it running.**

Update 2/24/2023: I have still unfortunately not gotten around to tranfering the code in Google to this repository, as I am dedicating my time to learning other useful tools and languages, and finding a part time job. But I will keep this project in mind for when I can find time for it.

Update 1/10/2023: The web application itself is currently contained within a Google Colab notebook, which I intend to try to transfer to this repository, and ensure that it is up and running.
