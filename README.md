This repository contains a dataset that I used in a Computer Science course for a final project, as well as functions to wrangle said dataset. It also includes some of the work I made in wrangling and tuning the data. It does not include any code to set up the website that is the final product.

For this project, I spent time building a pipeline for wrangling and tuning datasets, followed by training and testing of several machine learning models to attempt a prediction of a particular outcome. To do this, the user would input information into a website which would then be extracted by the models to do their predictions.

Credit goes to Stephen Fickas, the professor of the course, for assistance and a portion of the code used here.

The dataset was obtained from the following site:

Note: For security purposes, I have not included the files needed to run the aforementioned website. I still have them, however, and am willing to get them up and running again as needed.
